Hey everyone, 

8bit Duels has finally been released! After one year, I am proud to have completed it. I have explained everything in a release YouTube video. Watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKARl89Qos

I will now move on to other projects, probably not game development. It's been a really fun experience.

Bye for now,
